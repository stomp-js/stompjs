- Support for auto reconnect
- Minor documentation changes

## 2.4.9 (2016/04/01)

### STOMP 1.2 and RabbitMQ support

- deletion of durable subscriptions
- STOMP 1.2 ack/nack headers
- graceful shutdown

### API change

- the `unsubscribe()` method returned by `subscribe()` now takes an optional
  `headers` argument which can be used to pass headers like `durable:true` and
  `auto-delete:false` required by RabbitMQ to delete durable subscriptions

- for STOMP 1.2, `ack()` and `nack()` methods send an `id` header rather than
  a `message-id` header to match the incoming MESSAGE frame.

- although the `disconnectCallback` is still called immediately after transmitting
  a DISCONNECT frame, the websocket is not closed by the client until a RECEIPT is
  received. Note that due to server-side behaviour with respect to connection lingering
  the RECEIPT may never be received and the socket will be closed by the server.

## 2.0 (2012/11/29)

### STOMP 1.1 support

- heart-beat
- nack
- content-length

### API change

- the `errorCallback` passed to the `connect()` method is no longer called when the
  client is properly disconnected by calling `disconnect()`.

- ack() method takes 3 parameters:

  - `messageID` & `subscription` are MANDATORY.
  - `headers` is OPTIONAL

- the `client` object has a `heartbeat` field which can be used to configure heart-beating by changing its `incoming` and `outgoing` integer fields (default value for both is 10000ms):

  client.heartbeat.outgoing = 20000 // client will send heartbeats every 20000ms
  client.heartbeat.incoming = 0 // client does not want to receive heartbeats
  // from the server

### Minified version

In addition to the regular `stomp.js` file, the library is also available in a minified version `stomp.min.js`

### Annotated source

The source is now [documented](http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/stomp.html) :)
